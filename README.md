# Link Opener With Selenium
# You will need to have chromedriver and Selenium installed and running in order for this to work.
# You can use this code for anything you want and can change it or reproduce it
# or even sell it at any point as long as you don't use this for illegal purposes
# (I don't know how you would but don't).
# I am not liable for any complains for how you have used this
# or for anything that might affect your computer installing the appropriate tools.
# The video I have sent you is to help you with the selenium and chromedriver installation.
# It is not mine and belongs to Tim Ruscica (or Tech With Tim on youtube).
# Thank you for reading this and as a side note, verify where you have installed selenium and the chromedriver
# to keep yourself safe from viruses or other cyber attacks.
